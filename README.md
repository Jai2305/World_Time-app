# World_Time

This is my first flutter project and the concept is really simple.
This app use World Time api to fetch data and the u can see the time of that country
at a particular moment at the home page 

# Getting Started 
* The app starts by loading the home pafge which shows time for Germany ( Berlin)
the user can tap the Location options and choose the country/location
whose time they want to see. 
* The app fetches data from World Api ( http://worldtimeapi.org/ ) and 
navigates the user on the home page with the time of the location selected by the user
